# Precedent Study

A place to keep any mention of precedents, perhaps with some sort of linking between the process journal and here!? One can always hope!

## [Electroplankton](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/DS_Electroplankton.pdf) 
![[elektroplankton.png]]
Electroplankton is a great place to start. The 2005/2006 DS game is one of the first widely-available "musical toys." Andre Dolphin's paper [Defining Sound Toys: Play as Composition](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/37182/chapter-abstract/324106285?redirectedFrom=fulltext) discusses Electroplankton in great detail (along with Brian Eno's [*Bloom*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOTPjh6oA84)) and the main takeaway for me in his definition is that "competition as a motivation for interaction, are often avoided, encouraging the participant to solely focus on audiovisual experience and sonic-centric interaction." Think is a good stance to push up against, with the goal for this specific project being something in-between. Not quite a puzzle like Shadowmatic (see below) and not quite a "musical toy" like Electroplankton with no explicit "goals."

## [Shadowmatic](https://www.shadowmatic.com/)
![[shadowmatic.png]]
Triada Studio's Shadowmatic is doing a lot of the things I can imagine working well in this project. Where they have the user manipulating objects in digital spaces with a mouse, I could see users manipulating knobs which in turn affect the separate elements of a visual space. Some parts of this feel too "ta-da" and puzzly, but I like the idea of knob adjustments needing to work in tandem for a given end. One way to address this might be to set states that are not explicitly "right" or "ideal," but rather "specific." Keeping the visuals abstract can help with this (so "it's some sort of combination of shapes/colors/etc" and not "it's a horse!")

## [Love Hult√©n](https://www.lovehulten.com/)
![[loveHulten.png]]
Not much to say here except, "of course, this project will take direct influence from Love Hulton's synth designs." Though it should be noted that the [evobox](https://www.lovehulten.com/evoboxx.html) may be of particular interest here.

## [Nicky Case's Emoji Simulator](https://ncase.me/sim/)
![[emojiSim.png]]I have thought a lot of Nicky Case's interactive explainers while beginning to think of this project, but I think that their Emoji Simulator covers a lot of precedent-ground. The predator-prey modal fits especially really well. I like the idea of a more-complex [Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/) that is tied to sound-generation (again, see Love Hulton's evobox, above). The issue here is what do the controls actually change? Each element's movement? Reproduction or hunting rates? Numbers? I could see an even *more* complex simulation working (rainfall + plant growth + sunlight + predator + prey) but that starts to feel even more unwieldy (and possibly too environmentally preachy) You could abstract these "creatures" into abstract "shapes" but the programatic difficulty to make balance the system might not be worth the overhead.

## [Mu Cartographer](https://titouanm.com/mucartographer/)
![[muCartographer.png]]
Titouan Millet's *Mu Cartographer* is probably the closes thing to what I imagine this looking like with physical knobs/controls instead of the great abstract dials used here. Again this is a game in which you are searching for a specific right "state" to find things, but could be abstracted in a way. Also, the visuals here are obviously just so good. How to do something equally great but in a new paradigm? Flat 2D is a possibility (with [In Other Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM2bOvd752s) being the other obvious great precedent)

and three previous Mouse & the Billionaire pieces that this is clearly building on

adjust knobs to find patterns. Uncover secrets.

## [Furniture Music](https://github.com/Whaaat-Lab/furnitureMusic)

but BACKWARDS. Manipulating music results in visual updates.

## [TIKATMOS](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/tikatmos)
![[TIKATMOS-TunerScene.gif]]
turning knobs to get a desired outcome. To be honest, I keep thinking to myself of this project as a "better" implementation of the TIKATMOS tuner idea.

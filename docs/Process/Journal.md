## Context Statement | 09.01.23
The initial idea here is alt-control audio-based game-like interaction. Specifically, *what would a game controlled with a synthesizer look like?* 

The audio-component of this could be either
	a) an actual modular synthesizer that is used to control a visual element, or
	b) a simulated synth-like interface that controls computer-based sound and visuals

Either could be a good direction, but currently I am leaning toward a simulated synth because it would have a lower barrier of entry for players (i.e simpler control scheme) and could be designed for a cool physical visual aesthetic (a la [lovehulton](https://www.lovehulten.com/)) As far as the "game" element, interface-only is always a favorite here as is  "environmental"-sim (can we consider a [pizza pie](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/purrrfectPizza) an environment? I think so) but both that and the audio/physical aspects will shake out in the ideation phase.

Obviously this builds on previous work (especially [nY-Station](http://www.mouseandthebillionare.com/nys) and even ends up being a somewhat reverse [Furniture Music](https://github.com/Whaaat-Lab/furnitureMusic), but as I think about this are some strong precedents that are doing a lot of things that I'd like to borrow from. Specific detail on each in the [precedents](precedents.md) section, but calling out here some initial thoughts:  [lovehulton](https://www.lovehulten.com/) for physical interface (as mentioned above), [In Other Waters](https://www.fellowtraveller.games/in-other-waters) for screen-based interface, and both [Elektroplankton](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/DS_Electroplankton.pdf) and [Mu Cartographer](https://titouanm.com/mucartographer/) as more direct references (I'm leaning on Mu Cartographer a lot here in this early conception)

That's where we stand now!

Next Steps:
	Ideation
	Precedents

Let's go!

# Weekly Meeting Notes

### GV
RNBO:  
- Finally, Max-like patches can now be compiled for platforms like web browsers, VST/AU, C/C++.  
- it's pretty neat how patch-defined parameters are exposed in HTML without doing much additional coding  
- However, it's disappointing that dependencies or externals cannot be embedded in the compiled code due to licensing restrictions.  
- The $300 fee for a cloud-based WebAssembly compiler is rather steep.  
  
GRIT. ([https://www.timohoogland.com/grit/](https://www.timohoogland.com/grit/))  
- This simple yet nice sounding synth by Timo Hoogland utilizes RNBO.  
  
Sound-Controlled Games  
- Wolfenstein 3D controlled by sound. Demo video by St√∏j ([https://vimeo.com/207831279](https://vimeo.com/207831279))  
- Asteroids controlled by sound features using interactive machine learning. Webapp by Louis McCallum. ([https://mimicproject.com/code/ba532449-be46-2d30-70c4-1317839eadcf?embed=true](https://mimicproject.com/code/ba532449-be46-2d30-70c4-1317839eadcf?embed=true))  
  
Libraries for Interactive Machine Learning  
- InteractML: Unity plugin for interactive machine learning ([https://github.com/Interactml/iml-unity/tree/VRInterface](https://github.com/Interactml/iml-unity/tree/VRInterface))  
- Rapidlib: JS library for interactive machine learning ([https://mzed.github.io/RapidLib/](https://mzed.github.io/RapidLib/))  
  
For literature review, I recommend starting with Dolphin (2014) ([https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199797226.013.003](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199797226.013.003)) and research by Lobbers and Fazekas ([https://sebastianlobbers.com/research/](https://sebastianlobbers.com/research/))  
  
Upsammy's album Zoom (2020) is worth checking out ([https://open.spotify.com/album/6Fgw2NUHzJFbOQ5u4o0Clq?si=8A0vophFTKOoOeFxZ4uUtQ](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Fgw2NUHzJFbOQ5u4o0Clq?si=8A0vophFTKOoOeFxZ4uUtQ)). I think its vibe is suitable for all ages.  
  
Submit the project to A MAZE Festival Berlin (May 8-11, 2024). When is the submission deadline? MB: if last year is any indication (May 10-12, 2023) submissions start on 12/12ish and close 1/31.

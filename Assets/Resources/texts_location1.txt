She said she leaving for the west coast
She said she loves me, but another most
She said she's leaving, she's leaving now
Don't go leaving now and I'll start behaving.

he must catch the last subway, the streetcar, the bus, 
run up the gangplanks of all the steamboats, 
register at all the hotels, work in the cities, 
answer the want ads, learn the trades, take up the jobs, 
live in all the boardinghouses, sleep in all the beds. 
One bed is not enough, one job is not enough, 
one life is not enough.
 At night, head swimming with wants, 
he walks by himself alone.

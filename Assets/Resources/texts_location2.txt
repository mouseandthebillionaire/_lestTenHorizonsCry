I fear I am consigned to dwell 
amongst the monuments of all my failures 

all attempted with nothing but
the most honorable of intention

they are not colossal.
largely demure, 
  most are pathetic, 
    a few—inspired,
none are complete.

but a man can live within them,
finding shelter from the storm,
amid the punctuated canopy, 
the rare 
dry 
spot 
to lay his head,
and on clear nights 
an enviable view of 
that heavenly ribbons edge.

but shame is my roommate,
he is mostly quiet, but he is always home.

god how I hate my fucking roommate.

his is terrible 
because he is easily forgotten
until he is not
there at my shoulder

“why does nothing seem to work around here?
Perhaps you forgot to pay a bill,
Or just never thought of it again, 
after that furious obsessive episode?
Remember? That thing you dove headfirst into?

‘I’ve never seen him more enthusiastic!’
‘He said it makes him feel alive!’

and yet,
Here they all sit ,
the piles of Half Completed Fancies

destined for the rubbish heap—
well, if you gain a moment of Clarity
potent enough to actually throw something away.”

something other than my time
my precious life

# Analysis

A record of the analysis phase of the [Lest Ten Horizons Cry](./) project for the [Materializing Design](https://www.materializing.design/about) research project and potential future thesis work. Additionally, an exploration in using Obsidian as a platform for the QDA phase.

### 11.06.25 | Setup

Attempting to use Obsidian for QDA work on an existing repo. Just a quick note here as to what this setup looks like (though some of this is clear from the file structure)

- I am nesting this analysis vault _inside_ the original vault. I could have obviously created a new vault that either had its own repo or wasn't using git at all, but something about including it within the file structure of the original project feels more fitting with the MDM ethos.
- Also, separating out the analysis from the original material will hopefully help to maintain the structural integrity of that content in case I ever want to use it in some other manner.
- Also also, I'm wondering if keeping the analysis in a separate location will help facilitate the "analysis hat" lens.
- I am using the [Quadro](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-quadro) plugin for the coding. It looks pretty robust, and I think will do everything i need it to do (though it only has a 67/100 on [obsidianstats](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/quadro) so we'll see!)
- The initial goal here is to transfer over all of the files in the [Process](../docs/Process/) folder (Journal, MeetingNotes, Precedents, etc) for analysis. I will also look to create an export of all the commit messages as one file and analyze that as well (though we all know that I am lousy at the PB-level robust commit, so I don't expect that to be too fruitful, but you never know!)
- Note: the commit message export was so easy I thought I'd just add a little note for it here: you just need to navigate to the folder in the terminal and run: `git log --format='%B%n---' > commitMessages.txt`

On y va!

### 11.15.25 | Initial Readthrough

Spent the last few days reading through all of the (hashtag) Data to get a bird's eye view of the material. Already some ideas brewing, but trying to keep it on just a surface level. One note is that it is really interesting how divorced I feel from most of the content. Obviously, it is me, and I recognize the voice, but with the time between, I have less of a stake in the goals/desires/worries etc (even though much of it is stuff that I am still focusing on, which makes it even more interesting)

Another note: It is nice having multiple files to be looking through. Definitely feels like there's going to be different insights gleaned from the different streams of information

### 11.17.25 | Initial Analysis Pass

Fun! This was surprisingly enjoyable.

You definitely get into a groove while doing these. It is interesting how the thoughts, connections, framework, etc. arise in the actual DOING of this. It's worth knowing that this is the case, especially realizing that subsequent passes are going to reincorporate tags that get established later.

Halfway through I realized that I was tagging VERBS and OBJECTS that could be used in conjunction with each other ([referencing + precedents](Cide/referencing.md), as an example) Possibly not kosher in the classical QDA methodology, but seems to be a fun way to organize this material.

Next steps:
* Do a pass specifically thinking about [What do Prototypes Prototype](https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs247/2012/readings/WhatDoPrototypesPrototype.pdf) calling out which type of prototype is being documented for each stage. I like the idea of choosing a specific designerly lens, and reading through it that way. WDPP is the paper I think about most when doing this (and teaching) but Katherine McElroy's levels of fidelity from [Prototyping for Designers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prototyping-for-designers/9781491954072/) is another fun option.
* I am curious if it is worth cleaning up some of these tags if there is overlap (or if it is even appropriate)
* Once both those things are done, do a third (or fourth, depending) pass that applies all the previous knowledge to tagging the entire thing in a more consistent way
* Once that consistency is established, do an analysis pass of the MeetingNotes, CommitMessages, and Precedents data.

### 11.19.25 | Precedent Pass

I didn't document the WDPP pass because it was fairly expected. The various prototypes do slot into those categories. It _is_ interesting however to note that even I have a hard time delineating after the fact between the different prototype types. I wonder if this kind of organization could be helpful on the front end - as in, specifically calling out which type of prototype you are doing in the commit messages? Might be too prescriptive, but could also help to organize the making?

As for the precedent pass. It's neat to see how the ideas are already getting crystalized through this early stage. In hindsight, it seems like a mistake to have done this stage last (since it was actually the first stage in my development process). I could see the QDA of the precedent document being useful to start generating the goals that the project is shooting for (ie ambiguity, discovery, anti-puzzle, etc) As it is, I was able to slot in those ideas when looking back at the precdents, but could be more useful the other way around.

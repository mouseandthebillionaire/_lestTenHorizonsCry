# Analysis

A record of the analysis phase of the [Lest Ten Horizons Cry](./) project for the [Materializing Design](https://www.materializing.design/about) research project and potential future thesis work. Additionally, an exploration in using Obsidian as a platform for the QDA phase.

### 11.15.25 | Initial Readthrough

Spent the last few days reading through all of the (hashtag) Data to get a bird's eye view of the material. Already some ideas brewing, but trying to keep it on just a surface level. One note is that it is really interesting how divorced I feel from most of the content. Obviously, it is me, and I recognize the voice, but with the time between, I have less of a stake in the goals/desires/worries etc (even though much of it is stuff that I am still focusing on, which makes it even more interesting)

Another note: It is nice having multiple files to be looking through. Definitely feels like there's going to be different insights gleaned from the different streams of information

### 11.06.25 | Setup

Attempting to use Obsidian for QDA work on an existing repo. Just a quick note here as to what this setup looks like (though some of this is clear from the file structure)

- I am nesting this analysis vault _inside_ the original vault. I could have obviously created a new vault that either had its own repo or wasn't using git at all, but something about including it within the file structure of the original project feels more fitting with the MDM ethos.
- Also, separating out the analysis from the original material will hopefully help to maintain the structural integrity of that content in case I ever want to use it in some other manner.
- Also also, I'm wondering if keeping the analysis in a separate location will help facilitate the "analysis hat" lens.
- I am using the [Quadro](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-quadro) plugin for the coding. It looks pretty robust, and I think will do everything i need it to do (though it only has a 67/100 on [obsidianstats](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/quadro) so we'll see!)
- The initial goal here is to transfer over all of the files in the [Process](../docs/Process/) folder (Journal, MeetingNotes, Precedents, etc) for analysis. I will also look to create an export of all the commit messages as one file and analyze that as well (though we all know that I am lousy at the PB-level robust commit, so I don't expect that to be too fruitful, but you never know!)
- Note: the commit message export was so easy I thought I'd just add a little note for it here: you just need to navigate to the folder in the terminal and run: `git log --format='%B%n---' > commitMessages.txt`


On y va!
